                 <p> Hi , my name is Wesley Trujillo , I am a rising senior  at Urban assembly gateway school for technology with hopes of being able continue working for my school. I am a very social person with survival based confidence, I can make connections with anyone and make them open up even when i just met them. From a young age I've been able to use that to my advantage in a good way. I tend to over work myself to understand or finish a specific project . I'm always at 100% as long as i have determined people around me.   	</p>

                        <h3>What is my philosophy?</h3>
                        <p>People say failure should be seeked in any aspect of their life. I don't disagree .. but that's not true for me. Yes failure can can teach you many new things about your self. However, personally failure has made me question my values and I end up listening to people. Some advice are good, yet some are bad, leading to lack of motivation and work ethics. I alwasy try to find people that are equally or even slighly advanced than me because I get motivated to work because they are actually enthusiastic on working , and vice versa. </p>
